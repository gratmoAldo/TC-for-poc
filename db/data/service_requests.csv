"1","40320146","Mysterious mc_deleted_8101becea8005b503 mc_user","2","Open - Customer Action Required","Connect Server 5.3 SP4","PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
------------------------------------
Our connect checker picked up several names and locations that point to a user called...
mc_deleted_8101becea8005b503   (among others)

Any ideas on where this user would have originated from?

It does not look like a user that a Administrator would establish on their own.
(How many people do you know that name users like mc_deleted_8101becea8005b503 ???)

I need to know what process might be establishing this user and applying it as part of some ACL records as well as other system objects so that we can prevent trouble in the future.

Here is part of the checker report...
